## What is FoodWasteWatchers?

Our project uses generative AI to help individuals use ingredients in the fridge, purchase ingredients based on portion sizes, and understand how to store ingredients to extend shelf life. 

## Why FoodWasteWatchers?

Our app lets users

Customize Food Items: Users can input a variety of food items and receive tailored storage advice and expiration reminders.

Customizable Recipes: Users can input the ingredients they have on hand, and the AI will generate recipes that utilize these ingredients effectively, minimizing waste.

Visual Recognition and Recipe Suggestions:
Image Uploads for Ingredient Identification: Users can upload photos of their ingredients, and the AI will recognize and suggest recipes based on these images.
